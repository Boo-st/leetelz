2.a Install Raspbian on the Raspberry pi
	Raspbian is the operating system which runs on the raspberr pi, based on linux, what we are going to do in step 2.a is provide instructions on how
	to download the operating system, write the operating system to the Raspberry pi's SD card, and activate SSH on boot for easy configuration
	
	Navigate to the following "" and download the os image, unzip this file and open your imaging software like so
	
	
	Choose your SD card as the destination drive, the drive letter can be obtained under my computer for windows, or finder on mac
	Write the image to the SD card, once succesful we can insert the SD card into the pi and apply power
	
	Plug your raspberry pi into your router and navigate to your router's address to view the DHCP clients and find the address of the Pi
	
	Once the address has been found we can ssh into the unit by using the default ssh "hostname@IP"
	Once you are logged into the pi, we can expand the OS system into the rest of the SD card and enable VNC for GUI access of the RPI
	
	To expand the OS we run "sudo raspi-config" which will bring up a GUI, from here you can expand file system memory
